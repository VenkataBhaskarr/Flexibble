# This is a clone of dribble in Nextjs

## Things i have learned while doing this project are......

### headlessui
1. headlessui divides the components into logic and design where it provides the neccessary logic and design is upto the developers 🌚.

### cloudinary 
1. The main usecase of the cloudinary in this project is to store our media in the cloud and use as we need them ☁️.

### graphql
1. Graphql is a query language and also a runtime for fulling those queries
2. Apart from formal definintion this is what i understand

REST API is an architecture of how to perform CRUD for resources on the other hand graphql is a query language in itself.
