### graphql
1. Graphql is a query language and also a runtime for fulling those queries
2. every collection is assumed as a node and their types are considered as the node fingers now depending on the query the realtions between these nodes are formed on a whole this is visualized as a graph and hence the name is derived 

REST API is an architecture of how to perform CRUD for resources on the other hand graphql is a query language in itself.
